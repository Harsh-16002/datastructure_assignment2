        "\n",
        "# In Python, dictionary keys must be immutable because they need to remain consistent and hashable throughout the dictionary’s lifecycle. When a key is added to a dictionary, Python computes a hash value for that key, which is used to quickly retrieve the corresponding value. If a key were mutable, its value (and thus its hash) could change after insertion, leading to unpredictable behavior and making it impossible to retrieve the correct value.\n",

        "# Why Dictionary Keys Must Be Immutable\n",
        "# 1. Hashing and Fast Lookup:\n",
        "# Python dictionaries use a hash table internally. When you insert a key-value pair into a dictionary, Python computes the hash of the key to determine where to store the value. This enables fast lookups (average O(1) time complexity). For this to work, the hash value of the key must remain constant.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Immutability guarantees that the key's hash won’t change after insertion.\n",
        "# If the key were mutable, changing the key would alter its hash, making it impossible for the dictionary to find the value.\n",
        "# 2. Consistency in Data Retrieval:\n",
        "# Dictionaries rely on keys being constant to maintain data integrity. If keys could change, it would break the mapping between keys and values, leading to inconsistencies or key errors during lookups.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Example: If a mutable key (like a list) was allowed and modified after insertion, the dictionary would no longer know where to find the associated value.\n",
        "# 3. Preventing Unexpected Behavior:\n",
        "# Allowing mutable objects as keys would introduce numerous issues, such as accidental modification of the key after it's added, leading to key collisions or loss of data. Immutable keys avoid these kinds of problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Immutable vs Mutable Types as Dictionary Keys\n",
        "# Immutable types such as int, float, str, tuple, and frozenset can be used as dictionary keys.\n",
